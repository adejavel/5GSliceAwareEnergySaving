# Slice-aware energy saving algorithm for 5G networks based on simplicial homology: Simulations and code repository

This repository contains the code of the simulations done for paper: "Slice-aware energy saving algorithm for 5G networks based on simplicial homology". It also contains detailed diagrams for simulations

## Content
* The code and parameters can be found in the folder `code`.
* The simulations diagrams can be found in the folder `simulations`.


## Execution
This code is a basic matlab code. To run it, the first step is to create a parameters file containing the different parameters (4 files are given for eMBB, URLLC, MIoT and the three together but you can create others). Then the content of the parameters file has to be copied into the file `optimization.m`. Finally, the file `optimization.m` can be run as a classic Matlab file.
